# Neural-Physics-Sandbox-Engine

Goal: Build a real-time 3D sandbox engine where physics is not rule-based, but learned by an AI model.

Core Idea:
Instead of hardcoding Newtonian physics (like Unity or Unreal), train neural networks to approximate physical behaviors (collision, friction, elasticity, fluid, fire, particles, etc.) and integrate them into a real-time C++/Python-based game engine.

Tech Stack:

Language: C++ (core engine), Python (AI training)

AI: PyTorch (Graph Neural Networks for particle physics)

Rendering: OpenGL/Vulkan or Unreal Engine plugin

Physics Base: MuJoCo / PhysX / Bullet as reference

Data Science: Generate training data from real physics engines, then train models to predict frame-to-frame evolution.

Math: Linear algebra, tensors, ODEs, PDEs, numerical stability, and differential equations.

System: Multithreading, GPU compute (CUDA), data streaming from models.
